# gruntTest

This is just a test to find the best way to automate the setup of dependancies in future projects.

## Usage
After cloning the repo, run the following commands:

    $ npm install
This will install bower and grunt which will install dependancies for us.

    $ grunt
This will run bower and install dependancies that are specified in bower.json.

As long as there are no errors (warnings are ok), you can open index.html in a browser and it should load without any console or formatting errors.
